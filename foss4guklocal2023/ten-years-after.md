## Panel Discussion: Ten Years After

In 2013 a rag-tag team of UK geo-evangelists produced the 
global [FOSS4G 2013](http://2013.foss4g.org/) conference
in Nottingham, the first (and currently only) time it has
been held in the UK.

For the tenth anniversary of that conference, we have a panel selected
from the team to look at how things have changed in the geospatial
world in the last ten years, and more importantly to look ahead to the
next ten years.

Each member of the panel will have a ten-minute presentation, during
which time we will collect audience questions online, and then
put them, or summaries, to the panel for discussion.

## Panel

 * Steven Feldman
 * Mark Iliffe
 * Abigail Page
 * Matt Walker
 
## Moderator

Barry Rowlingson will moderate the panel unless he find someone
else to do it! Volunteers please?!
